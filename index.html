          <h1 id="part1">Part 1</h1>
          <p>Harry Potter is a wizard at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is a miraculous boy who somehow surivived a killing curse by Lord Voldemort, who was defeated by a toddler. #REKT. Anyway, so he goes on to live with his aunt and uncle. His cousin, Dudley, is so fat he counts as <i>2 cousins</i>. Anyway, he has a crummy life in his miserable broomshed, and nearly starves to death in the middle of a suburban community. But this all changes when the house gets attacked by flying letters from Hogwarts, and his uncle is so paranoid that he won't allow Harry to be a wizard. This makes no sense because his uncle never wanted to take Harry in anyway. #LOGIC.  </p>
          <h1 id="part2">Part2</h1>
          <p> Anyway, when the giant Hagrid harrasses his aunt and uncle into sending Harry to Hogwarts. So Harry finds he is famous for 360 noscoping Voldemort, and is known throughout the Wizarding community as <b>The Chosen MLG</b>. Anyway, he is sorted into Gryffindor, who are sort of the productive people. He makes enemies with Slytherin, the hood of Hogwarts. #ThugLyfe. Anyway, so he hears about the Sorcerer's Stone and Nicolas Flamel with his friends Ron Weasly and Hermione Granger. Ron is sort of the incompent n00b in the trio, while Hermione is part of Faze Clan. Anyway, they find out that Voldemort<sup>TM</sup> has returned and is possesing the back of Professor Quirrel. Then they have a giant death batttle, while Hermione performs an exocism, and frees Professer Quirrel from Voldemort. Professor Quirrel then turns into a giant pumpkin. Voldemort takes a full body, but forgets that he left his wand back home in his kitchen. Then, Ron tries to use Avada Kedavra on Voldemort, but instead he blows up Great Britain, and turns the sea into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Thus, NATO was formed so that Ron Weasly would be banned from magic for the rest of his life. </p>
